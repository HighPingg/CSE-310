# TCP PCAP Analysis Tool

`analysis_pcap_tcp.py` is a package written in python that allows you to quickly
analyze PCAP files generated by TCP Dumps. It just prints out some simple information
about the different flows going on.

## Dependencies

The [dpkt](https://github.com/kbandla/dpkt) package is required to run 
`analysis_pcap_tcp.py`. It can be installed through
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), using the command:

```bash
pip install dpkt
```

A version of Python 3 that's compatible with dpkt must also be installed.

## Usage

How my program works is that `analyze()` inside `analysis_pcap_tcp.py` will take in a
path to a PCAP file and then loop through that PCAP file. Each packet it detects will
be compared against existing `TCPFlow` objects. If the packet belongs in an existing
flow inside the `flows[]` array, then that packet will enter that flow, otherwise a 
new flow will be created. After the program runs out of packets to analyze, then it
print out a summary of the different flows detected.

>*Note: This program will only work if new flows are created. Existing flows will be
ignored.*

To run, first `analysis_pcap_tcp.py` **and** `TCPFlow.py`
**must be in the same directory**. Then all that needs to be done is to just run:

```
python analysis_pcap_tcp.py
```

To change the PCAP file that it runs with, all thats needed is to change the path to
the PCAP in the `analyze('path')` function call on the bottom of the source file or to
run python in shell mode and call `analyze()` yourself.
